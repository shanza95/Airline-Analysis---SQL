# Airline-Analysis---SQL

### Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world database management scenario for an aviation company named Air Cargo, which offers both passenger and freight services through partnerships with other airlines. The objective is to analyze air travel data to improve operational efficiency, optimize route planning, and enhance the customer experience.

### Business Problem
Air Cargo wants to gain deeper insights into its operations by identifying:
- Regular passengers (to offer loyalty benefits)
- Busiest routes (to better allocate aircraft)
- Ticket sales patterns (to improve revenue and pricing strategy).

These insights will support customer-centric decisions and better resource management.
